If the plugin is unable to discover your device, it's likely you've locked the device with the cloud so it no longer accepts local connections. In this case, follow these steps:
1. Open the [Broadlink app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/broadlink/id1450257910)
2. From the Home screen, tap on your Broadlink device
3. Tap the ... in the top right
4. Scroll down and toggle "Lock device" to Off
5. Tap OK when prompted "Confirm to unlock the device"
