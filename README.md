## Documentation

If the plugin is unable to discover your device, it's likely you've registered the device with the cloud so it no longer accepts local connections. In this case, follow these steps:
1. Hold the reset button on your broadlink device until the light flashes
2. In the IHC app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/intelligent-home-center/id1084990073) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.com.broadlink.econtrol.plus&hl=en)) Go through the "Add Device" steps
3. When you reach the step to add the device to a room - quit the IHC app

This plugin should now be able to discover your device.

Base documentation can be found [here](https://lprhodes.github.io/slate/). With the following additional configuration options available in this fork:

### Switch Accessory

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
pingGrace (optional) | Pauses ping status changes for the specified period (seconds) to allow device to start-up/shutdown after the change | 15 | 10

### Aircon Accessory

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
w1DeviceID (optional) | Updates device current temperature from a Raspberry Pi Wire-1 thermometers (i.e. ds18b20). Value is the Device ID | 28-0321544e531ff | 
heatOnly (optional) | Forces the Aircon accessory to only operate in Heat mode | true | false
coolOnly (optional) | Forces the Aircon accessory to only operate in Cool mode | true | false

#### "data" key-value object
The device can be setup to manage modes in one of two ways. If your AC unit accepts a hexcade to change mode only (without temperature details) you can set the mode keys (heat/cool) and then the temperatureX values to change the teperature. If your AC unit sends hexcodes that contain the mode AND temperature you can use the modeX codes alone.

When the mode is changed the mode hexcodes are sent first - if set. Then the modeX code is sent to set the temperature, if it is set. If a matching modeX code can't be found, the temperatureX code is sent.  If neither of these temperature codes are found either defaultHeatTemperature or defaultCoolTemperature codes will be used depending on if the target Temperature is higher or lower than the current temperature.

key | description
--- | -----------
off | A hex code string to be sent when the air conditioner is asked to be turned off.
temperatureX | A hex code string where X is any temperature you wish to support e.g. "temperature30".
modeX | A hex code string where X is any temperture, and mode is one of "heat","cool", or "auto". Hex code used to set unit to the specified mode and temperature

#### "temperatureX" and "modeX" key-value object
